To see how you can add code snippets, see below:

```html
  <div class="box">
    <img class="img" src="images/image-qr-code.png" alt="Hallelujah">
    <div class="textBox">
      <h1 id="t1">Improve your front-end skills by building projects</h1>
      <p id="t2">Scan the QR-code to visit Frontend Mentor and take your coding skills to the next level</p>
    </div>
  </div>
</body>
```
```css
    .box {
      height: 497px;
      width: 320px;
      background-color: hsl(0, 0%, 100%);
      justify-content: center;
      padding-top: 15px;
      border-radius: 20px;
    }

    .img {
      height: 288px;
      width: 288px;
      justify-content: center;
      border-radius: 10px;
